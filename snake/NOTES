snake moves a little bit each round
if the player pressed a direction key the snake will move in the direction pressed
direction keys are w, a, s, d, up, left, down, right

if snake eats a fruit, he grows one tile in length
how this works is the snake will move as usual but the tail will not move forward

the snake's tail moves a tile forward first, then the head
