# Style

- 4 column wide hard tabs, not spaces.
- 80 column soft limit.
- 120 column hard limit.

Don't unnecessarily break lines like when it's 2 characters over soft limit.
Exceptions can be made for the hard limit, e.g. when there's not really a logical place to break the line or if there are a bunch of really long lines like in an initialization block.
I strongly dislike unnecessarily breaking lines so just use your brain and don't feel bad about not following the line length limits too strictly.

Follow the [D style guide](https://dlang.org/dstyle.html) but make exceptions for the rules outlined above.
