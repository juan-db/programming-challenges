# To-do

## Core

- ~~Load entries from a JSON file.~~
- ~~Save entries to a JSON file.~~
- ~~Display entries on the screen.~~
- ~~Add a new root entry from in-app.~~
- ~~Add a new child entry from in-app.~~
- Delete an entry from in-app.

## Extra

- Improve UI (it's quite terrible rn).
- Move actions to a separate file and store them in some sort of registry.
- Add some way of displaying entries that are longer than the terminal window. Probably expand them when they're selected.
