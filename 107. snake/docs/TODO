 Core
======
- abstract away the curses object completely, having a hidden update call
- use one window for map and one for hud
- have only the windows publicly exposed and not the curses object
- get rid of the nice.curses package and use the bare ncurses package


 Game Logic
============
- move snake in the direction the user pressed
- make snake die when eating his tail or hitting the edge of the map
- add fruit spawning
- make the snake grow when eating a fruit
